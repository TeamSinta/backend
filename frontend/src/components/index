# About components folder

---

In React, components are the building blocks of your application's user interface. They are reusable pieces of code that define the structure, behavior, and appearance of different parts of your application.

The components folder is a common place to store all of the different components that you create for your application. This can include both functional and class components, depending on your project's requirements.

When organizing your components folder, it's important to create subfolders for related components. For example, you might have a form subfolder for all of the components related to user input forms, such as a TextInput component or a SubmitButton component.

By organizing your components in this way, you can make it easier to find and manage them as your application grows in complexity. It can also help you to create a more modular, reusable codebase that is easier to maintain over time.

I hope that helps explain what the components folder is for in a React project! Let me know if you have any other questions. -- suwon
