# About common folder

---

For example, you might have a Button component that is used in multiple parts of your application, such as in forms, in navigation menus, or as a call-to-action on different pages. Instead of duplicating this component code in multiple places, you can create a `Button` component in the components/common folder and reuse it wherever you need it.

**_ We decided common components already. _**
[common components]('https://www.notion.so/Common-components-01608e90cfbc4a90a421056a4c9cd120')

By organizing these commonly used components in the components/common folder, you can create a centralized location for them and make them easier to manage and update. This can help you to reduce code duplication, improve code maintainability, and create a more efficient and effective codebase.

I hope that helps explain what the components/common folder is for in a React project! Let me know if you have any other questions. -- suwon
