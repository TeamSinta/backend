# About Styles folder

---

When using styled components in a React project, we can organize our CSS files into different modules to make our code easier to manage. For instance, we might create a GlobalStyle.ts file that contains CSS code to reset or normalize the default styles of HTML elements. This ensures that our application looks consistent across different browsers and devices.

We can also create a theme.ts file that contains commonly used CSS properties or values that we can reuse throughout our application. This allows us to define our colors, fonts, spacing, and other design elements in a central location and use them consistently across our components.

In addition to these files, we can create separate CSS files for specific components or features in our application. For instance, we might create a media.ts file to define CSS styles for different screen sizes or device types, or an animations.ts file to define reusable animations that we can apply to different components.

By organizing our CSS code this way, we can keep our code more modular and easier to maintain, while using styled components to create a visually consistent user interface for our application.

I hope that explanation helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. -- suwon
