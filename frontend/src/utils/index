# About Utils folder

---

The util folder is basically a place where you can store helper functions that don't directly relate to the main business logic of your application, but are still super important for it to function properly.

For example, you could put functions that format dates, validate user input, or handle API requests in this folder. By keeping these functions separate from the main code, you can keep your code more organized and easier to maintain. Plus, it makes it easier to reuse these functions across different parts of your application.

### Detail Example

1. Date formatting functions - Functions that take a date as an input and return a formatted date string in a particular format.

2. Validation functions - Functions that validate user input such as email addresses, phone numbers, or passwords.

3. API helper functions - Functions that handle API requests and responses, and are used to communicate with the backend of the application.

4. String manipulation functions - Functions that manipulate strings in a particular way, such as trimming whitespace, converting case, or replacing characters.

5. Math helper functions - Functions that perform mathematical calculations, such as rounding numbers or calculating percentages.
