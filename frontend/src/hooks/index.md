# About hooks folder

---

The hooks folder is a common place to store custom hooks that you create for your application.

Custom hooks are functions that you write to encapsulate certain behavior or functionality in your application. By doing this, you can reuse the same logic across multiple components, which can make your code easier to manage and more modular.

By keeping your custom hooks in a separate hooks folder, you can easily find and manage them, and make sure that they are being used consistently across your application.

I hope that helps explain what the hooks folder is for in a React project! Let me know if you have any other questions. -- suwon
